- I can set up recurring maintenance tasks
- I can track completion of maintenance activities
- I can view upcoming maintenance requirements
- I can assign maintenance tasks to specific technicians

---

### Story 6: Generate Sensor Reports
**As an** inventory manager  
**I want** to generate reports on sensor inventory and usage  
**So that** I can make informed decisions about sensor procurement and deployment

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- I can generate inventory reports showing all sensors and their status
- I can create utilization reports showing sensor deployment patterns
- I can generate maintenance reports showing completed and pending activities
- I can export reports in multiple formats (PDF, Excel, CSV)
- I can schedule automated report generation

---

### Story 7: Search and Filter Sensors
**As a** system user  
**I want** to search and filter sensors based on various criteria  
**So that** I can quickly find specific sensors or groups of sensors

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- I can search sensors by ID, serial number, model, or location
- I can filter sensors by status, type, manufacturer, or date ranges
- I can combine multiple search criteria
- Search results are displayed in a clear, sortable format
- I can save frequently used search filters

---

### Story 8: Manage Sensor Lifecycle
**As an** asset manager  
**I want** to track the complete lifecycle of sensors from procurement to disposal  
**So that** I can optimize asset utilization and plan for replacements

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- I can record sensor procurement information (purchase date, cost, vendor)
- I can track warranty information and expiration dates
- I can manage sensor transfers between departments or locations
- I can process sensor retirement and disposal
- I can view complete lifecycle history for each sensor

---

### Story 9: Configure Sensor Alerts
**As a** system administrator  
**I want** to set up automated alerts for sensor-related events  
**So that** I can proactively manage sensor issues and maintenance needs

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- I can configure alerts for maintenance due dates
- I can set up notifications for sensor status changes
- I can create alerts for unusual sensor readings or failures
- I can specify alert recipients and delivery methods (email, SMS)
- I can manage alert frequency and escalation rules

---

### Story 10: Integrate with External Systems
**As a** system integrator  
**I want** to connect the sensor management system with other enterprise systems  
**So that** sensor data can be shared across the organization efficiently

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- I can configure API connections to external monitoring systems
- I can export sensor data to business intelligence platforms
- I can import sensor specifications from manufacturer databases
- I can synchronize sensor information with CMMS (Computerized Maintenance Management System)
- I can set up real-time data feeds for critical sensors

## Notes
- All user stories should be implemented with appropriate security controls
- User interface should be intuitive and accessible
- System should maintain audit trails for all sensor-related activities
- Performance requirements should support large numbers of sensors (scalability)
